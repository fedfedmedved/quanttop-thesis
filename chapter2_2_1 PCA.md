### PCA
One of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction algorithms is Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
Its origins "are often difficult to trace" according to
<!--[@TODO book].-->
The core concept of PCA is of a nature so fundamental, that is was discovered multiple times throughout history.
Since PCA is versatile and has multiple applications, it is still frequently referenced in current research publications.
A common application is that of visualizing data.

What PCA does
It is a statistical method to extract information on data's highest variance.


matrix factorization
linear
global not local
 
orthogonal vectors


V directions of maximum variance
orthogonal to each other

project points onto V vectors
U values of projected points
