### Thesis Outline
The main body of this thesis is structured as follows:

* Chapter 2 describes related algorithms, for conceptual understanding of the domain. It also includes a description of the central UMAP algorithm.

* Chapter 3 covers the approach to parallelizing UMAP.

* Chapter 4 contains technical information on the implementation.

* Chapter 5 presents run time measurements of the implementation.

* Chapter 6 discusses the results and compares them with run times of other algorithms.

* Chapter 7 concludes the thesis. Suggestions on possible future works are given.
