### UMAP {#umap}
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

<!--It can be used for other things than just visualization, as it allows for the usage of non-metric distance functions and can efficiently embed data into more than two dimensions.-->
<!--UMAP also supports to map data into an existing embedding, without the need of reapplying the algorithm to the entire data set.-->




<!-- TODO mention partial update -->
