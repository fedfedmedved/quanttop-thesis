## Clustering
Clustering algorithms are useful for numerous tasks, across multiple fields. In the context of this thesis we are mostly just interested in the way they can provide visual aid when representing low dimensional data, by grouping related data points together.

There are multiple approaches to find clusters. Covered here are the two of the most commonly used algorithms, _k-Means_ and _DBSCAN_. Both take a fundamentally different approach on how to cluster points, yielding from a different concept of clusters. _k-Means_ defines clusters as points centered around one single center, while _DBSCAN_ finds clusters of arbitrary shape as long as the data points form a point cloud that is connected densely enough.
