@book{Bishop2007,
abstract = {$\backslash$nThis book provides an introduction to the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. It gives an overview of several basic and advanced topics in machine learning theory. The book is definitely valuable to scientists and engineers who are involved in developing machine learning tools applied to signal and image processing applications. This book is also suitable for courses on machine learning and pattern recognition, designed for advanced undergraduates or PhD students. No previous knowledge of machine learning concepts or algorithms is assumed, but readers need some knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. The book is complemented by a great deal of additional supports for instructors and students. The supports include solutions to the exercises in each chapter, the example data sets used throughout the book and the forthcoming companion book that deals with practical and software implementations of the key algorithms. A strong point of this book is that the mathematical expressions or algorithms are usually accompanied with colorful graphs and figures. This definitely helps to communicate the concepts much better to the students or the interested researchers than pure description of the algorithms. The book also provides an interesting short biography of the key scientists and mathematicians who have contributed historically to the basic mathematical concepts and methods in each chapter.$\backslash$n},
