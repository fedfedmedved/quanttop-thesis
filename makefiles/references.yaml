  abstract: A d-dimensional simplicial mesh is a Delaunay triangulation if the circumsphere
    of each of its simplices does not contain any vertices inside. A mesh is well
    shaped if the maximum aspect ratio of all its simplices is bounded from above
    by a constant. It is a long-term open problem to generate well-shaped d-dimensional
    Delaunay meshes for a given polyhedral domain. In this paper, we present a refinement-based
    method that generates well-shaped d-dimensional Delaunay meshes for any PLC domain
    with no small input angles. Furthermore, we show that the generated well-shaped
    mesh has O(n) d-simplices, where n is the smallest number of d-simplices of any
    almost-good meshes for the same domain. Here a mesh is almost-good if each of
    its simplices has a bounded circumradius to the shortest edge length ratio.
