### DBSCAN
One of the biggest disadvantages of the _k-Means_ algorithm, is that it relys on the assumption of all clusters having one single center. This prevents effective discovery of shapes other than circular, especially non-convex forms.

DBSCAN, short for "Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise" was introduced in 1996 by Ester et. al. [@Daszykowski2010].
Instead of circles - network alike -

The approach used
 It defines clusters based on the assumption that clusters 

This allows for finding of non-convex clusters, which don't have a single center.
