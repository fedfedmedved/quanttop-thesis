"Visual exploration is an essential component of data analysis" as van der Maaten et. al. [@bhtsne] put it.
Nowadays visualization of data is commonly achieved by using dimensionality reduction algorithms, since the data is of too high-dimensional complexity.
Before dimensionality reduction algorithms were state of the art, clustering algorithms were commonly used to obtain a representation of the data in human perceivable form.
Clustering algorithms are still very important in data analysis and share approaches with dimensionality reduction algorithms.
Thus the following first gives a overview of clustering algorithms, followed by an examination of reduction algorithms, concluding with a summary of the thesis' main algorithm, UMAP.
