# Preliminaries {#preliminaries}
The following sections will give an overview on clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction algorithms.
For each algorithm a description and a general implementation overview in pseudo code will be given.
Furthermore, the time complexity of each algorithm is given and explained.
Eventually, since parallelization is a central element of this thesis, each algorithm is also accompanied by a brief analysis on how it can be parallelized.
