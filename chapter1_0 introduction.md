# Introduction
This chapter covers the background and motivation of the thesis, related works, as well as the thesis' aims.
Chapter 2 describes related algorithms, for conceptual understanding of the domain, and the central UMAP algorithm.
How a parallelized UMAP implementation can be achieved is detailed in chapter 3.
Further technical information on the implementation is given in chapter 4.
Run time measurements of the implementation are presented in chapter 5.
They are compared with other runtimes and evaluted in chapter 6.
Chapter 7 concludes the thesis, suggestions on possible future works are given.
